hopwave
======

**hopwave** is the tool in the hands of every traveler to enable them to **easily find and book their tickets for every itinerary between all the connected islands**. It informs you about all the available destinations around your current location and allows you to plan your trip while getting useful information about the means of transport you are about to use. Organise your own **island hopping** using all possible sea transportation options like boats, cruiseships, yachts, or even hydroplanes!

Hopwave is currently a mobile app but we also provide a dashboard to the boat owners where they can see how many tickets are booked and update the existing data about their trips. 

Regarding the mobile app (Android and iOS), it is built with [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) and uses online data stored on [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/). The dashboard which we provide to the boat owner as well as the landing page are built with [Laravel](http://laravel.com/). All of the direct links to firebase are corrupted. If you want to run the code with real data, please send us a mail: info@hopwave.com
